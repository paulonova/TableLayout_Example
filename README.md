# TableLayout_Example
Android's visual component, TableLayout (and TableRow). This layout component is very used to working with forms (although I prefer to work with LinearLayout and the hint attribute in the form of widgets). Note the true functionality of stretchCoumns and shrinkColumns attributes and how to perform the merge (merge) columns using the attribute of internal widgets to TableRow, layout_span. Another thing that I quote is the meclagem problem of lines trivial in the <table> HTML, well, if only there is no mistake me merge lines in Android when using the GridView layout component (subject to future posts) , so the TableLayout component does not support the feature of merging lines.
